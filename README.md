# Extrem-Weaher-Event-Simulation
The project that I currently work on concerns the simulation of Tropical Cyclones during their lifetime. The first point of this is to track the path that it follows, investigating the evolution of some Climatic variables that evolve when the cyclone is active and the correlation between them.   
The track was applied to a cyclone near Madagascar, and the dataset we use were dowloaded via the implementation of our Atmospheric model; therefore, to run those codes, you need data shaped the same way as you can see. Feel free for any questions.
