# Extrem-Weaher-Event-Simulation
The projet that I curently work on consern the simulation of Tropical Cyclones during its life time. The first point of this is to track the ath that it follows, investigating the evolution of some Climatic variables which evolve when the cyclone is active and the correlation between them.   
The track was applied to a cyclone near Madagascar and the dataset we use were dowloaded via the imlementation of our Atmosheric model, therefore to run those codes you need data shape the same way as you can see. Feel free for any question.
